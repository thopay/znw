<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/5bf403244adec2ebb73c65b13940efeb.png">

This is my take on an anonymous chat platform based on websockets. This was inspired by a tutorial by Pretty Printed, but utilized my own HTML, JS, and CSS.

Here's why:
* No logs of chat or who's who
* After every refresh a new name is assigned, so it's designed to be anonymous
* Extremely simple to join a room and start talking

### Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [SocketIO](https://socket.io)
